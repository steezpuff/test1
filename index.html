            How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
            Leading you down into my core
            Where I've become so numb
            Without a soul
            My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
            Until you find it there and lead it back home

            Wake me up inside (save me)
            Call my name and save me from the dark (wake me up)
            Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
            Before I come undone (save me)
            Save me from the nothing I've become

            Now that I know what I'm without
            You can't just leave me
            Breathe into me and make me real
            Bring (bring) me (me) to life

            Wake me up inside (save me)
            Call my name and save me from the dark (wake me up)
            Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
            Before I come undone (save me)
            Save me from the nothing I've become

            Bring me to life
            I've been living a lie
            There's nothing inside
            Bring me to life

            Frozen (frozen) inside without your touch
            Without your love, darling
            Only (only) you are the life among the dead

            All of this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
            Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
            I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
            Got to open my eyes to everything
            Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
            Don't let me die here
            (There must be something more) bring me to life

            Wake me up inside (save me)
            Call my name and save me from the dark (wake me up)
            Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
            Before I come undone (save me)
            Save me from the nothing I've become

            Bring me to life
            I've been living a lie
            There's nothing inside
            Bring me to life
